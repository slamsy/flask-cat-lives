free until july
taking porch-traits
we are taking necessary steps
we've taken numerous precautions
during times of volatility
more important than ever
suspending all nonessential travel
we made the difficult decision
everything seems tentative
quickly trying to adjust
the cbc is your trusted source for coronavirus information
stay two meters apart or the length of a hockey stick
I think you are on mute
flatten the curve
stay home, prevent the spread
