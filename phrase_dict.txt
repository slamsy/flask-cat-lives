shall i compare thee to a summer's day?
all the world's a stage.
now is the winter of our discontent.
if you prick us, do we not bleed?
the lady doth protest too much, methinks.
let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments.
but, for my own part, it was greek to me.
what light through yonder window breaks.
